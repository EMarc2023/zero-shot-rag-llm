# zero-shot-rag-llm

Project Overview:

Developed a production-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the Amazon Review 2023 dataset. The system leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques for knowledge retrieval and document summarization with minimal training data requirements.

Key Technologies:

HuggingFace Transformers: For pre-trained transformer models used in both retrieval and generation tasks.

FAISS: Efficient similarity search for fast document retrieval at scale.

LangChain: For orchestrating RAG-style workflows with language models.

FastAPI: Deployed as a production-ready web application for API access to the RAG system.

Docker: Containerized the entire application for consistency and scalability.

CI/CD: Fully automated deployment pipeline with tests, linting, and Docker integration for streamlined development and production flow.

Project Features:

Zero-Shot Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Enables the model to retrieve relevant documents and generate insightful summaries without requiring task-specific training.

Production-Grade Deployment: Dockerized API with FastAPI, ensuring scalability, modularity, and ease of deployment in cloud or on-prem environments.

Code Quality & Maintenance:

Pylint Score: 10/10 (Ensures clean, maintainable code)

CI/CD Pipeline: Fully automated with unit tests, linting, and Docker integration. Build time ~11 minutes.

Applications:

This project can be applied to industries that require efficient AI-driven knowledge retrieval and document summarization, such as:

Enterprise Solutions: Automating document analysis and retrieval.

Customer Support: Answering customer queries based on large document datasets.

Content Generation: Summarizing or generating new content based on vast knowledge bases.

Future Enhancements

Model Performance Metrics: Planned refinements to include standard evaluation metrics like BLEU, F1 score, etc.

Optimization: Further model fine-tuning and performance benchmarking to enhance retrieval accuracy and generation quality.

Frontend UI: Developing a React.js-based frontend for a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the system and visualize retrieved documents and generated summaries easily. This will provide a complete full-stack experience, from backend API to frontend deployment
